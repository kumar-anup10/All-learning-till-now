            <p>Faith, dutifulness, compassion, good thoughts, character, non-attachment, helping nature, fearlessness,
                love, wisdom, spirituality, responsibility, truth, strength within, the company of the good etc. are
                some traits which are recommended by Vivekananda for personality development.</p>

            <p>Vivekananda believed that every soul is destined for perfection and will ultimately attain a state of
                perfection. A human being has five layers or sheaths - physical, vital, mental, intellectual, and
                blissful. Today's education can develop the first four sheaths but not the fifth, which requires
                spiritual knowledge.</p>
